# What is Scalaris?

Scalaris is a scalable, transactional, distributed key-value store. It
was the first NoSQL database, that supported the ACID properties for
multi-key transactions. It can be used for building scalable Web 2.0
services.

Scalaris uses a structured overlay with a non-blocking Paxos commit
protocol for transaction processing with strong consistency over
replicas. Scalaris is implemented in Erlang.
